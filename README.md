# week-18-ss-api

## Your Task
Your task is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice (Moment.js) or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.

No seed data is provided, so you’ll need to create your own data using Insomnia after you’ve created your API.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

## Languages Used
NodeJS
Express
MongoDB
Mongoose ODM

## Project Notes
All routes are working for users are working but not for thoughts. and since the reactions are placed on thoughts, you cant place reactions yet either. For some reason my app keeps crashing at when i attempted to create a thought. Walkthrough shows everything.
